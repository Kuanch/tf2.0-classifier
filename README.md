# tf2.0-classifier
Rewrite a simple CNN classifier with tensorflow 2.0 alpha, apply [iWild dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/iwildcam-2019-fgvc6) on Kaggle.


# iWild Dateset
This is an FGVCx competition as part of the FGVC6 workshop at CVPR 2019, and is sponsored by Microsoft AI for Earth. There is a github page for the competition here. Please open an issue if you have questions or problems with the dataset.


# Things to work
- [ ] Evaluate classification benchmark with classic model like Inception.
- [ ] Arrange new coding style on Tensorflow 2.0.
- [ ] Design a custom model to kickoff iwild dataset.
- [ ] Add model summary tool to assess model efficiency.
- [ ] Imporve data pipeline of dataset api on Tensorflow 2.0.
